## Software engineer

I'm an <em color="green">engineering student</em> at INSA de Rouen specialised in software engineering (5th year out of 5). I've learnt lot of stuff there. The courses are mainly about programming and software design. I became fond of <em color="green">Object-Oriented software</em> design which I practiced using Java and C++. I've discovered Linux and it happens to be something I really enjoy using every day.

I love to work in teams and I believe that <em color="green">collective
    intelligence</em> enables us to do better and greater things. During one
year, I've worked with 8 other students for a financial reporting company called
[Invoke](http://www.invoke-software.fr). We were happy to work together,
sometimes late, and some other times very early, but always with <em
    color="green">good will</em>. It was very fun and the project was a success at the end.

<!-- I've learnt many technical and soft skills during this project. As the IT manager, I had to maintain the server, deploy a continous integration tool-chain and ensure backups. As the -->
<!-- project manager assistant, I've worked with <em color="green">Agility</em> using a quality management system. -->

## I.T. Enthusiast

I am interested in I.T. in general. I daily use <em
    color="purple">Archlinux</em>, I generally manage my servers with <em color="purple">Debian</em> and I support open-source and free softwares as much as possible (mainly via github).  I like to use <span class="crossed">old</span> proven tools like <em color="purple">Vim</em>, <em color="purple">Git</em> and <em color="purple" title="No, no.. it is a tool to write documents">LaTeX</em>, as well as brand new technologies like <em color="purple">Docker</em>.  

I read a lot of blog post via rss, twitter and reddit to keep myself up to date.
My favorite topics are <em color="purple">functionnal programming</em> and <em color="purple">continous
    integration infrastucture</em>. I also like to read more introspective
posts that make me question my point of view.

I've been part of <em color="purple">Quantic Télécom</em> operation team. I recommend you to
have a look at it.

## Passionate musician

Music is certainly one of the most essential things to me. I listen to music all
the time, from classical music to indie rock, passing by jazz or funk. I'm
particularly a big fan of the <em color="orange">Arctic Monkeys</em>.

That passion comes from the fact that I went to music school for about 10 years,
learning drums, music theory, and music orchestra. Now, I have a band called
<em color="orange">Mattress</em>. We like to compose, rehearse, perfom live. What I like is
going in studio to record and produce our songs.
